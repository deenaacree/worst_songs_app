I Want My Baby Back,Jimmy Cross,1965,"In 1977, British DJ Kenny Everett named the novelty song as the absolute worst of a bottom thirty song listing done after a public vote. The single was a moderate commercial success but killed the singing career of its vocalist, Jimmy Cross, who failed to achieve any kind of traction with serious work afterward. A parody of the teenage tragedy song trend, the lyrics of the song feature a male protagonist lamenting the death of his girlfriend before, finally, joining her in her coffin. In the book The World's Worst Records: Volume One, music critic Darryl W. Bullock wrote that the track is '[r]outinely considered the worst record of all time'.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Cross,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo8DhbQw_O4
