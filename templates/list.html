  <h1>List of Songs Considered the Worst</h1>

  <p>This is a list of the 22 songs considered to be the worst in recent history. The songs that are listed here were taken from this Wikipedia List: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_music_considered_the_worst#Songs">List of music considered the worst</a>.</p>

  <p>For each song, you will find the song title, artist name, year of release, information about why it is included on the list, a link to the Wikipedia page about the song (or, in cases where a song page does not exist, the artist page), and a YouTube video for the song.</p>
